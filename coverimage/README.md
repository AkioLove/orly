# CoverImages

The animal(well, not all are animal) images are from the [USF ClipArt ETC](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/) project.

Images are listed in `asset.list`, a plain text file.

They are not included in this repo by design.

# Get Images

Connect to Internet, run:

```bash
go run downloader.go
```

# Build Thumbnails

To build thumbnails for frontend usage, run:

```bash
go run thumbnail.go
```

# Generate Frontend Code

For beneficence from Webpack inline bundle, 
code that lists thumbnails in HTML can be generated by running:

```bash
go run frontendcodegen.go
```
